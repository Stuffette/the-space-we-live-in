[project] team "manifold mixer" developing a depth color sensor project to explain space concepts

## TEAM MEMBERS

* Alia Taliaferrow
* Evan Misshula
* Lucy Pullen
* Stuart Lynn

## PROBLEM

Spacetime is complex. We want to explain multi-dimensional space in a creative and understandable way.

## PURPOSE

Using Kinnect Depth sensors and footage from particle tracking cloud chambers, we want to use this artistic representation of the hidden nature of Spacetime. We want the viewer to imagine existing in space that contains hidden dimensions.
